# RFM-analysis-using-Python

RFM Analysis is used to understand and segment customers based on their buying behaviour. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value, which are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.

**RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.**

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers:
  - recency (the date they made their last purchase)
  - frequency (how often they make purchases)
  - and monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)


We assigned scores from 5 to 1 to calculate the recency score, where a higher score indicates a more recent purchase.

We assigned scores from 1 to 5 to calculate the frequency score, where a higher score indicates a higher purchase frequency.

To calculate the monetary score, we assigned scores from 1 to 5, where a higher score indicates a higher amount spent by the customer.

**To calculate the RFM score, we add the scores obtained for recency, frequency and monetary value. For example, if a customer has a recency score of 3, a frequency score of 4, and a monetary score of 5, their RFM score will be 12.**
